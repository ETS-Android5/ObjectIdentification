# ObjectIdentification

Implemented object identification android application to achieve the best accuracy using Inception convolutional neural network model. A main purpose of this project is to experiment with object recognition applications using two different models based on integer and float values. A model based on integer values is very time effective but it costs accuracy. On the other hand, a float model is very successful in providing the best accuracy taking a longer time.
